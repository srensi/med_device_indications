Approval of the AngelMed Guardian System. This device is indicated for use in patients who have had prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events and who remain at high risk for recurrent ACS events.The Guardian System is indicated as an adjunct to patient recognized symptoms. The Guardian System detects potential ongoing ACS events, characterized by sustained ST segment changes, and alerts the patient to seek medical attention for those potential ACS events. A Guardian System alert is a more accurate predictor of ACS events when compared to patient recognized symptoms alone and demonstrates a reduced rate over time of patient presentations without ACS events (false positives) when compared to patient recognized symptoms alone. In the absence of symptoms, the Guardian System may identify asymptomatic ACS events and prompt the patient to seek medical attention.
