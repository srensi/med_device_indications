# Medical Device Indication Annotation

This repository features documentation, data, and code for participating in the shared annotation task of generating a structured database linking medical devices to their indications.

## Permarket Approval Corpus

Our corpus of premarket approval statements mentioning class III device indications can be found at on our [PubAnnotation project page.](http://pubannotation.org/projects/blah6_medical_device)

The ipython notebook pma_corpus_builder.ipynb contains code for downloading data from OpenFDA, parsing it, and uploading to PubAnnotation.
